Epigraph Invalidation
=====================

This is a PHP class to generate random icons for your projects.

The same way you choose a "code name" for your projects much before you choose the "marketing name",
the icon is always a problem:

* If you want to use "the deefault icon", your project gets confused with any other default project.
This applies to favicons for web projects, android icons, desktop icons, or whatever.

* If you use any drawing program to make a fast icon, it will look ugly and worst: it will consume you time.

With **Epigraph Invalidation,** you just load the page and get an icon.

* If you like it, download.
* If you don't like it, just reload the page.

This is strongly inspired on those icon-generators appearing as avatar-generators in blogs,
wordpresses and even github itself.

But I didn't like a monochrome icon, as well as I found that a roundish form would allow many more variations,
so I decided to create something like a 2-layer icon: A layer acts as a "basis" and the other acts as "pipes" connecting
dots in the basis. This allows 2 colors and much more impact.

Download the project in any directory in your PHP-enabled web-server (make user you have GD library)
and just load index.html in a browser.
